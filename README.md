# Arduino-based Adaptive Environment Control System​​​​​​​ | Do-It-Yourself Team Project

• Developed an adaptive environment control system utilizing Arduino as a microcontroller and Arduino IDE for programming. Implemented a fan speed controller that adjusts its speed based on the surrounding temperature, ensuring optimal cooling.

• Additionally, designed an adaptive light system that dynamically adjusts brightness based on the surrounding brightness levels, providing optimal illumination. Utilized an LCD display to provide real-time temperature and fan speed feedback.

• Demonstrated proficiency in embedded systems programming, sensor integration, and creating intelligent control systems to enhance comfort and energy efficiency
